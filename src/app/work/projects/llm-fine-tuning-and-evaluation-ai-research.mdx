## Overview

As a Project Manager and Data Analyst at Scale AI, I played a critical role in supporting the fine-tuning, evaluation, and alignment of large language models for top-tier AI research institutions including OpenAI, Meta AI, and others. Working on the cutting edge of AI development, I managed data pipelines, coordinated global contributor teams, and ensured the quality and consistency of training data used to shape the next generation of AI systems. This work required deep understanding of machine learning workflows, meticulous attention to detail, and the ability to scale operations across distributed teams.

## Key Responsibilities

- **LLM Fine-Tuning Support**: Analyzed model outputs, identified training gaps, and provided structured feedback to guide fine-tuning processes. Worked directly with research teams to understand model behavior and contributed to iterative improvements of model performance and safety.

- **Data Quality and Consistency**: Designed and implemented rigorous quality assurance protocols to ensure training data met strict consistency standards. Conducted systematic reviews of labeled data, identified patterns of error, and implemented corrective measures to maintain data integrity at scale.

- **Global Contributor Team Management**: Led and trained distributed teams of data labelers and annotators across multiple time zones. Developed training materials, established quality benchmarks, and created feedback loops to maintain high performance standards and consistency across all contributors.

- **Data Pipeline Orchestration**: Built and maintained data processing pipelines that ingested raw datasets, applied filtering and validation rules, and prepared cleaned data for model training. Integrated multiple data sources and ensured seamless flow from collection to model training.

- **Analytical Reporting and Insights**: Generated comprehensive reports analyzing model performance, data quality metrics, and contributor productivity. Provided actionable insights to leadership and research teams to guide strategic decisions and process improvements.

- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Collaborated with OpenAI, Meta AI, and other research partners to understand their specific requirements and translate them into operational workflows. Ensured project outcomes aligned with strategic goals and research objectives.

## Technologies and Methodologies

- **Data Analysis**: Python, SQL, statistical analysis, data visualization
- **ML Workflows**: Understanding of transformer architectures, fine-tuning techniques, evaluation metrics
- **Project Management**: Airtable, workflow automation, performance tracking dashboards
- **Quality Assurance**: Statistical sampling, inter-rater reliability analysis, systematic error classification
- **Team Collaboration**: Cross-functional communication, distributed team coordination, documentation
- **Process Optimization**: Workflow automation, bottleneck identification, efficiency improvements

## Project Highlights

**LLM Alignment and Safety Evaluation**

Contributed to evaluating and improving model alignment by analyzing model responses to diverse prompts. Worked with research teams to classify output quality, identify failure modes, and provide feedback that informed model tuning strategies. This work ensured models behaved safely and predictably across a wide range of use cases.

**Data Labeling at Scale**

Managed projects involving thousands of data points, coordinating labeler teams to ensure consistent annotation quality. Implemented statistical monitoring to detect quality drift and immediately corrected annotation patterns when needed. Achieved 97%+ inter-rater agreement on complex classification tasks.

**Workflow Automation and Process Optimization**

Designed automated data validation pipelines that reduced manual review time by 60%. Built Airtable-based dashboards that provided real-time visibility into project progress, quality metrics, and contributor performance. These systems enabled rapid scaling of operations without proportional increases in overhead.

**Research-to-Operations Translation**

Served as a bridge between research teams and operational execution. Translated complex research requirements into clear operational procedures, ensuring that data collection and annotation aligned precisely with research objectives. This attention to detail was critical for model training success.

## Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge**: Maintaining consistent data quality across hundreds of contributors working asynchronously across multiple time zones and languages.
- **Solution**: Developed comprehensive training protocols with clear examples and edge cases. Implemented real-time quality monitoring and provided daily feedback loops to contributors. Created escalation procedures for ambiguous cases requiring research team input.

**Challenge**: Understanding nuanced research requirements and translating them into operationalizable annotation guidelines.
- **Solution**: Established regular sync meetings with research partners, created detailed specification documents with examples, and ran pilot batches to validate interpretations before scaling to full volume.

**Challenge**: Scaling operations to handle massive datasets (millions of data points) while maintaining quality.
- **Solution**: Built automated validation and statistical sampling frameworks that allowed quality monitoring without reviewing every data point. Used predictive analytics to identify potentially problematic annotators before quality degradation.

**Challenge**: Balancing speed and quality in fast-moving AI research environments where timelines were aggressive.
- **Solution**: Implemented tiered quality approaches—critical data received 100% human review while lower-risk data used automated validation, optimizing both speed and accuracy.

## Outcome and Impact

Contributed significantly to multiple cutting-edge AI projects:

- **97%+ Quality Metrics**: Consistently achieved high inter-rater agreement and data quality standards across all projects
- **Scaled Operations**: Managed projects growing from 10K to 100K+ data points while maintaining quality standards
- **Research Acceleration**: High-quality, consistently labeled data enabled research teams to move faster through model development cycles
- **Process Innovation**: Automated workflows reduced operational overhead by 40%, allowing focus on high-value quality assurance tasks
- **Team Development**: Trained and managed contributor teams that became reliable partners for ongoing AI research projects

## Skills Demonstrated

This experience showcases expertise in:

- **AI/ML Operations**: Understanding of ML workflows, model training, and evaluation practices
- **Data Quality Management**: Statistical approaches to quality assurance, error classification, and process improvement
- **Large-Scale Project Management**: Coordinating complex, multi-stakeholder projects with distributed teams
- **Leadership and Training**: Building and coaching global teams, establishing quality standards, and maintaining consistency
- **Data Analysis**: Extracting insights from large datasets, identifying patterns, and driving data-informed decisions
- **Process Automation**: Building efficient workflows that scale without sacrificing quality
