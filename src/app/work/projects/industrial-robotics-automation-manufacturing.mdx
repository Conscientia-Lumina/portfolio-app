## Overview

Over five years working with industry leaders including Volkswagen AG and BMW, I developed expertise in designing, programming, and optimizing industrial robotic systems for automotive manufacturing. This project demonstrates my ability to transform legacy manufacturing processes into intelligent, automated workflows that significantly reduce cycle times, improve quality control, and enhance overall production efficiency. By combining KUKA robot programming expertise with process optimization strategies, I delivered solutions that maintained the highest quality standards while maximizing throughput.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Robot Programming**: Programmed KUKA KRC 2, KRC 4, and ENGEL systems using proprietary programming languages and offline simulation tools. Developed complex motion sequences, integrated vision systems, and implemented real-time error handling for component removal, trimming, printing, and laser applications.

- **Offline Simulation and Validation**: Utilized PC-based simulation platforms to validate robot trajectories, collision detection, and cycle times before on-site deployment. This reduced commissioning time by 45% and minimized production downtime during implementation.

- **PLC and Communication Integration**: Established robust communication interfaces between robotic systems and PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers) and SGM (Shop Floor Messaging) systems. Ensured seamless data exchange for coordinated multi-robot workflows and real-time process monitoring.

- **Process Optimization and Changeover Management**: Analyzed production workflows to identify automation opportunities and designed system reconfigurations for product changeovers. Adapted existing systems to accommodate new product specifications without major infrastructure overhauls, reducing changeover time from days to hours.

- **Quality Control Automation**: Implemented automated inspection and quality control protocols integrated with robotic systems. Designed vision-based verification processes that caught defects in real-time, reducing scrap rates by 28%.

- **Component Removal Automation**: Engineered intelligent robotic systems for automated component removal from injection molding machines and trimming operations. Programmed adaptive motion control to handle variations in part geometry and positioning.

## Technologies Used

- **Robot Programming**: KUKA KRC 2, KRC 4, ENGEL systems; proprietary programming languages
- **Simulation**: PC-based offline simulation platforms for trajectory validation and optimization
- **Control Systems**: PLC integration, SGM communication protocols, real-time control logic
- **Manufacturing Domains**: Injection molding, trimming, printing, laser systems, material handling
- **Tools**: Git/GitHub for code versioning, systematic documentation and technical specifications
- **Industrial Partners**: Volkswagen AG, BMW, Faurecia, Plastic Omnium

## Architecture and Implementation

**System Integration Workflow:**

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Collaborated with production teams to understand current bottlenecks, part geometry, and production targets
2. **Simulation Phase**: Built detailed offline models to validate trajectories, cycle times, and collision-free operation
3. **Programming**: Developed robust robot programs with error handling, emergency stops, and adaptive logic
4. **Integration**: Connected robotic controllers to PLC systems and shop floor networks for coordinated operation
5. **Commissioning**: On-site installation, calibration, and optimization with continuous monitoring
6. **Training & Documentation**: Provided comprehensive technical documentation and operator training

## Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge**: Adapting legacy robotic systems to accommodate new product specifications and changeovers.
- **Solution**: Developed modular programming approaches and flexible gripper systems that could be reconfigured without complete system redesign, reducing changeover downtime from 24 hours to 2-3 hours.

**Challenge**: Ensuring production systems remained operational during implementation with minimal downtime.
- **Solution**: Used offline simulation to validate every step before deployment, enabling quick on-site commissioning. Implemented phased rollout strategy, testing on non-critical production lines first.

**Challenge**: Maintaining high-quality output while operating at maximum cycle times.
- **Solution**: Integrated real-time vision-based quality checks and sensor feedback into the robotic control logic, enabling instant detection and correction of deviations.

**Challenge**: Managing communication between multiple robotic systems and legacy PLC controllers.
- **Solution**: Established standardized communication protocols and developed middleware layers to ensure reliable, real-time data exchange across heterogeneous systems.

## Outcome and Impact

The industrial automation initiatives delivered measurable business results:

- **35% Reduction in Cycle Times**: Optimized robot trajectories and eliminated unnecessary movements, reducing production cycle time per unit
- **28% Reduction in Scrap Rates**: Automated quality control integrated into robotic systems caught defects immediately, reducing waste and rework costs
- **90% Reduction in Changeover Time**: Modular programming and adaptive systems reduced product changeover from 24 hours to 2-3 hours
