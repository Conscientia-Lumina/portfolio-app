## Manufacturing Engineering Principles Applied

This experience reinforced fundamental engineering principles:

**Root Cause Analysis**: Always dig deeper than surface symptoms to find underlying causes. A machine that stops working is a symptom; worn bearings are the root cause.

**Data-Driven Decision Making**: Measure everything—cycle times, defect rates, downtime. Use data to identify trends and validate improvements.

**Continuous Improvement Mindset**: No process is perfect. Small improvements compound over time. Encourage everyone to contribute ideas.

**Process Ownership**: When you understand a process deeply, you can optimize it. Spend time on the production floor, not in offices.

**Safety and Reliability First**: Rushing leads to mistakes. Invest time upfront in setup and quality to prevent problems later.
