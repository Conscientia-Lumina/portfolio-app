## Overview

Flowtify is a comprehensive full-stack platform built for business teams that require adaptability without sacrificing capability. Understanding that each organization has unique workflows, I developed a fully customizable KPI dashboard and workflow automation system that conforms to a company’s specific processes instead of enforcing rigid structures. By leveraging modern frontend technologies, a reliable backend, and smart automation, Flowtify allows teams to track metrics, manage operations, and automate tasks efficiently—even for non-technical users.

## Core Problem

Traditional business management software often expects businesses to adapt their operations to the tool. This results in inefficiencies, data fragmentation, and restricted innovation. Small and medium-sized enterprises need a platform that is both powerful and adaptable, starting simple but capable of growing alongside the organization’s evolving requirements.

## Solution Architecture

Flowtify is built as a modular and flexible system that acts as a foundation for operations rather than a static software package. Its architecture enables rapid customization while ensuring enterprise-grade stability.

### Data Layer: Supabase (PostgreSQL) and Airtable

- **Primary Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL provides structured relational storage with strong consistency.
- **Real-Time Sync**: Leveraged Supabase subscriptions for live frontend updates.
- **Secondary Storage**: Airtable serves as a flexible store for semi-structured data and user-defined fields.
- **Data Alignment**: Created bi-directional synchronization pipelines to maintain consistency across both systems.

### Automation Layer: Make (formerly Zapier) and n8n

- **Low-Code Automation**: Configured Make workflows for integration with 1000+ external apps (Slack, Google Sheets, Stripe, etc.).
- **Custom Automation**: Used n8n for complex, tailored workflows requiring advanced logic.
- **Trigger-Based Actions**: Workflows activated by KPI thresholds, data changes, or scheduled events.
- **Error Management**: Implemented retry mechanisms and alerting for failed automation runs.
