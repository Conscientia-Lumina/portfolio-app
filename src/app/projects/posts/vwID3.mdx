## Project Overview

Over several months at Volkswagen's Wolfsburg facility, I spearheaded the complete automation of trunk cover manufacturing for the VW ID.3 and ID.4 electric vehicles. This large-scale industrial automation project involved commissioning multiple robotic cells, developing custom control logic, and ensuring seamless integration with existing production systems.

## Key Responsibilities

### Robot Commissioning & Programming
- Commissioned and configured industrial robots for automated trunk cover handling and assembly
- Developed motion routines and logic sequences for precise component placement and quality control
- Integrated vision systems for real-time defect detection and positioning accuracy

### Collaboration & Project Management
- Worked closely with VW executives at both strategic and operational levels to align technical solutions with production goals
- Coordinated with cross-functional teams including mechanical engineers, quality assurance, and plant operations
- Facilitated knowledge transfer sessions with VW production staff for ongoing maintenance

### Production Optimization
- Implemented continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) practices for ongoing production improvements
- Optimized cycle times through systematic analysis of bottlenecks and process refinements
- Reduced production downtime by developing robust error-handling and recovery procedures

## Technical Challenges

### PLC Integration
Successfully integrated robotic systems with Volkswagen's existing Siemens PLC infrastructure, ensuring reliable communication and coordinated sequencing across multiple production stations.

### Debugging & Troubleshooting
Identified and resolved critical issues during commissioning phase, including timing conflicts, sensor calibration problems, and motion path optimization challenges.

### Quality Assurance
Established automated quality checkpoints throughout the production line, significantly reducing defect rates and ensuring consistent output quality.

## Results & Impact

- **Achieved full automation** of trunk cover manufacturing process for two vehicle models
- **Optimized cycle times** through iterative improvements and data-driven analysis
- **Minimized production downtime** with robust error handling and preventive maintenance protocols
- **Enhanced product quality** through automated inspection and precision robotics
- **Successful handover** to VW production team with comprehensive documentation and training

## Technologies Used
