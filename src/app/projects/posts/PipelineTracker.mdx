## Project Overview

I identified a critical need for improved visibility and management across distributed coding projects and contributor teams. To address this
gap, I designed and developed a comprehensive Project Pipeline Tracker, leveraging Airtable and custom automation tools to create a centralized
data hub. This innovative platform connects project data with contributor competency assessments, providing real-time insights into pipeline
performance, skill sets, and resource allocation. 

## Challenges Faced

### Visibility Gaps
Recognized the need for improved visibility across distributed coding projects and contributor teams, which led me to develop the Project
Pipeline Tracker.

### Data Disconnectedness
Identified that project data was not being effectively connected with contributor competency assessments, leading to a lack of real-time insights
into pipeline performance.

### Inefficient Onboarding
Acknowledged that onboarding new contributors was a manual, time-consuming process, and saw an opportunity to streamline it through automation.

### Decision-Making Barriers
Faced challenges in making data-driven decisions due to the absence of centralized project pipeline tracking, leading me to develop a platform
that empowers informed decision-making.

## Key Contributions
